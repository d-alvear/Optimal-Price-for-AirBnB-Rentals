    "# Optimal Price for an AirBnB Rental\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "AirBnB is a marketplace for short term rentals that allows users to list part or all of a living space for others to rent. Users can rent everything from a room in an apartment to your entire house on AirBnB. Because most of the listings are on a short-term basis, AirBnB has grown to become a popular alternative to hotels. The company itself has grown from it's founding in 2008 to a 30 billion dollar valuation in 2016 and is currently worth more than any hotel chain in the world.\n",
    "## Problem Definition\n",
    "One challenge that hosts looking to rent their living space face is determining the optimal nightly rent price. In many areas, renters are presented with a good selection of listings and can filter on criteria like price, number of bedrooms, room type and more. Since AirBnB is a marketplace, the amount a host can charge on a nightly basis is closely linked to the dynamics of the marketplace. In this project I will be taking on the role of a host wanting to rent my living space.\n",
    "As a host, if I try to charge above market price for my living space, then renters will select more affordable alternatives which are similar to mine. If I set my nightly rent price too low, I could miss out on potential revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "One strategy I could use is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* find a few listings that are similar to mine (k=5),\n",
    "* average the listed price for the ones most similar to mine,\n",
    "* set my listing price to this calculated average price.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project I will use data on local listings to predict the optimal price to set for a rental. I will use the __K-Nearest Neighbors__ algorithm to solve this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Data\n",
    "While AirBnB doesn't release any data on the listings in their marketplace, a separate group named _Inside AirBnB_ has extracted data on a sample of the listings for many of the major cities on the website. I'll be working with their dataset from October 3, 2015 on the listings from Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States. Here's a [direct link to that dataset.](http://data.insideairbnb.com/united-states/dc/washington-dc/2015-10-03/data/listings.csv.gz) Each row in the dataset is a specific listing that's available for renting on AirBnB in the Washington, D.C. area.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data file is named `dc_airbnb.csv`, the columns and their descriptions are below:\n",
    "* `host_response_rate`: the response rate of the host\n",
    "* `host_acceptance_rate`: number of requests to the host that convert to rentals\n",
    "* `host_listings_count`: number of other listings the host has\n",
    "* `latitude`: latitude dimension of the geographic coordinates\n",
    "* `longitude`: longitude part of the coordinates\n",
    "* `city`: the city the living space resides\n",
    "* `zipcode`: the zip code the living space resides\n",
    "* `state`: the state the living space resides\n",
    "* `accommodates`: the number of guests the rental can accommodate\n",
    "* `room_type`: the type of living space (Private room, Shared room or Entire home/apt\n",
    "* `bedrooms`: number of bedrooms included in the rental\n",
    "* `bathrooms`: number of bathrooms included in the rental\n",
    "* `beds`: number of beds included in the rental\n",
    "* `price`: nightly price for the rental\n",
    "* `cleaning_fee`: additional fee used for cleaning the living space after the guest leaves\n",
    "* `security_deposit`: refundable security deposit, in case of damages\n",
    "* `minimum_nights`: minimum number of nights a guest can stay for the rental\n",
    "* `maximum_nights`: maximum number of nights a guest can stay for the rental\n",
    "* `number_of_reviews`: number of reviews that previous guests have left\n",
    "\n",
    "I will start by reading the data in as a dataframe and prepare the data for analysis."
